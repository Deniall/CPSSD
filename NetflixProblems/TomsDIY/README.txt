Compulsory Problem 1: Tom's DIY Store

by Niall Walsh

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To run the code:

- Extract the .rar file.
- Go into the main "TomsDIYFinal" folder inside the extracted one.
- Inside that one, there is both a file and another folder named "TomsDIYFinal". Go into the folder.
- Inside this, there are two files named "TomsDIYFinal". One has .csproj at the end and is 1KB in size. Open the other one (which is 4kb in size).
- This will open up the Visual Studio Community 2015 IDE and the project will be compilable. 
- To run the code, click "Start" at the top. A console window should appear with an item code catalouge and instructions on what to do.

This was created in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015, so I advise running it in the same environment. I have not tested running it on other IDE's. However, the release .exe file can be found in TomsDIYFinal/TomsDIYFinal/bin/Release so if there are problems viewing the source code, the runnable .exe can always be found in there. 
The "Program.cs" file is the one that contains all the code and that can be opened in any environment.
