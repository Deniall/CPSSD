Tom’s DIY store is struggling to compete against the big players in the market. He has decided to hold a sale. Write a program which calculates the percentage deduction for the shop items below:

Before-sale prices:

Boxes of any size screws are €2.50 each
Sandpaper is 55c per sheet
Lampshades are €30
Picture frames are €7.99
Paint brushes are €6.95
Large tins of paint cost €34.50
Small tins of paint cost €9.95
Ceramic garden pots are all €10
All plants are €7
The following reductions apply to the bill:

All paint is half price.
All gardening products have 25% off.
Total values of up to €50 get 5% off
Total values of between €50 and €100 get 7.5% off
Total values of between €100 and €250 get 10% off
Anything over €250 gets a 15% reduction
Note:

Total value refers to the total cost off all goods including paint and gardening before any deductions. If the absolute total comes to 124 then the customer gets 50% off any paint purchases, 25% off gardening and 10% off all other purchases.
The paint and gardening special offer cannot be combined with any other offer (e.g. this must be calculated separately; paint to the value of €34.50 is reduced to €17.25 and the 5-15% is not applied on top of this)
Your program should take as input the customer’s shopping basket and print out:

The total bill before deductions are applied
The total deduction amount
The final bill after deductions have been applied
Test your program for as many scenarios as you can think of.
