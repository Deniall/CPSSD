A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards as backwards, e.g. radar. Write a recursive function which checks whether a string is a palindrome. Write an iterative function which checks whether a string is a palindrome. Your program should be case-insensitive.

Sample Input:

Sample Output:

NO

PART TWO:

An anagram of a string X is another string that contains the same letters as X but not necessarily in the same order, e.g. the word angle is an anagram of glean. Write a program which takes in a string and figures out whether any anagram of the string can be a palindrome.

Your program should be case-insensitive.
