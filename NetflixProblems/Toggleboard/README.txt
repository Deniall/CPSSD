Compulsory Problem 3: Toggleboard
by Niall Walsh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To view source code:
- Open the "Toggleboard" folder contained in the zip file.
- Open the "Toggleboard" folder inside that one.
- The source code is contained within 'Program.cs'

To run the program:
- Open the source code in your C# compiler of choice and run it.
- If you have Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015, double-click "Toggleboard.csproj" with the little green C# icon. This will open the full project and you can just click "Start" at the top and run it.
- IF you are using another software to run the code, it can probably be acheived by creating an empty project and copying and pasting the 'Program.cs' source code into the file created by the empty project, and running that.

If you cannot get the source code to compile, a runnable .exe can be found in Toggleboard\Toggleboard\bin\Debug.
